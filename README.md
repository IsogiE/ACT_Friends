# ACT Friends
For use of friends of Advance

For use in your guild, it's advised only officers download this and then re-distribute locally (e.g. via Discord) to the rest of their guild. Why?
You'll be required to manually change one line of code in Nickname.lua with the BattleTags of your officers/raid leader. 
This can be found on line 76 for the function "local function IsPrivilegedUser()"

Note: You will have to change this every time you update through WoWUp.
